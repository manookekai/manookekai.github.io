		<h1>About me</h1>
                <p>Hey, I'm Kai Stevens and I'm sixteen years old.  I was born here on Oahu but because my mom was in the military we left the island when I was only one years old, I lived in Arizona, Colorado, and Maryland before coming back to Oahu as a 12 year old.</p>
		
		<h1>Hobbies</h1>
		<p>My hobbies are chilling or going to the beach with my friends, playing video games (Rainbow six siege, ufc 3, RDR2), and sleeping.</p>
               
		<h1>Why I joined AP Computer Science</h1>
		<p>I joined AP computer science because I believed it would help me if I get a career in Electrical Engineering which is one of the main careers I'm thinking about pursuing.  I also joined APCS because I thought it would be a fun class to join and although
			I was right it is also one of the most challenging classes I've joined.</p>
